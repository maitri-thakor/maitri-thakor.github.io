    <p><b>&bull;What is Emotional Intelligence?
    </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand, use, and manage emotions in a positive way. 
      It involves being able to perceive, interpret, and respond to emotions, both your own and those of others. 
      Emotionally intelligent people are able to communicate effectively, empathize with others, and manage conflict. 
      They are also better equipped to handle stress, overcome challenges, and achieve their goals. 
      </p>
      <p>
      For example, a person with high EI might be able to tell that a friend is upset even if the friend doesn't explicitly say so,
       and they might know how to respond in a way that helps their friend feel supported. 
       They might also be able to manage their own emotions in a stressful situation, like a job interview, by taking deep breaths
        and staying calm. EI is important for effective communication, empathy, conflict management, and stress management. 
        It can be improved through practice and training, and is often considered just as important as IQ for success in life.
    </p>

    <p><b>&bull;How is EQ different to IQ?
    </b>
    </p>

    <h3>Emotional Intelligence (EQ):</h3>
    
    <p>&bull;
      EQ refers to a person's ability to recognize, understand, and manage their own emotions, 
    as well as understand and influence the emotions of others.
      </p>
      <p>&bull;
        It involves skills such as self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, motivation, and social skills.
        </p>
        <p>&bull;
          EQ is more about interpersonal skills, how well you understand and manage emotions, and how effectively you interact with others.
          </p>

    <h3>Intelligence Quotient (IQ):</h3>
    
    <p>&bull;
      IQ is a measure of cognitive abilities, including reasoning, problem-solving, logical thinking, memory, and processing speed.
      </p>
      <p>&bull;
        It's often assessed through standardized tests that measure various aspects of cognitive function.
        </p>
        <p>&bull;
          IQ is more focused on intellectual abilities and how well you perform tasks related to logical reasoning,
           language comprehension, mathematics, and spatial awareness.
          </p>

          <p><u>Here are some key differences between EQ and IQ:</u></p>

          <h3>&bull;Nature of Measurement:</h3>
          <p>EQ measures emotional intelligence, while IQ measures cognitive intelligence.</p>

          <h3>&bull;Skills Assessed::</h3>
          <p>EQ focuses on emotional and social skills, while IQ assesses cognitive abilities.</p>

          <h3>&bull;Application:</h3>
          <p>EQ is more relevant in social interactions, leadership, teamwork, and emotional well-being, 
            whereas IQ is often associated with academic and professional success.</p>
            <br>

    <p><b>&bull;Why is EQ important?
    </b></p>

     <p>
      Emotional intelligence (EQ) is important because it allows individuals to understand, use,
       and manage their own emotions, as well as the emotions of others, in positive ways. 
       This is important for effective communication, empathy, conflict management, and stress management.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the workplace, EQ is important for building strong relationships with colleagues and clients, managing conflicts,
       and leading teams effectively. Emotionally intelligent leaders are better able to understand the needs and concerns of 
       their team members, and they are more effective at motivating and supporting them.
     </p>
     <p>
    Overall, EQ is an important aspect of personal and professional success, and it can be improved through practice and training.
     It is often considered just as important as IQ for success in life.
