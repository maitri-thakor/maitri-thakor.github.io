    <p><b>1.What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning? </b>
    </p> 
    <p>I have found that core learning is a more engaging and motivating way to learn, as it challenges me to 
      think deeply and critically about a subject, which in turn increases my motivation to continue learning
       and growing.</p>

    <p>That core learning can help reduce anxiety and stress, as I feel more confident in my 
      understanding of the subject matter and am better able to apply what I have learned to new situations. </p>

    <p>Core learning encourages me to think creatively and explore new ideas, which can lead to innovation 
      and creativity not only in my studies but also in other areas of my life.</p>

      <p><b>2.What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?  </b></p>
      <p>I have found that values, empathy, and self-awareness play important roles in  my learning and programming. </p>
      <p>&bullet;Values help me choose what to focus on and what's important to me.</p>

       <p>&bullet;Empathy helps me understand others and work well with them.</p>
        
       <p>&bullet;Self-awareness helps me recognize my own strengths and weaknesses, and helps me learn and 
        improve.</p>

        <p><b>3.What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b></p>
        <p>What has surprised me the most about core learning is that going into a subject deeply might not seem 
          like it would take up a lot of time or make a big difference in learning. But it does! Core learning means 
          thinking hard and critically about a subject, which can be tough and take a while. However, it's worth it, 
          as it helps me understand the subject more and makes learning more meaningful.</p>

      <p><b>4.What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b></p>
      <p>The most challenging aspect for me was maintaining motivation and perseverance, especially during challenging times.</p>

      <p><b>5.Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web 
        development Bootcamp course?</b></p>
      <p>We prioritize core learning because programming is essential for developing a logical and structured way of thinking,
         which is necessary for effective problem-solving and decision-making in web development. It also establishes 
         the foundation for specific job roles and responsibilities in web development.That's why it's important to develop 
         skills like working with others, taking responsibility for your actions, and problem-solving independently.</p>

      <p><b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that 
        time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</b></p>

      <p>No, the time I spent studying core learning here did not feel like a waste of time. Core learning was essential 
        for building a strong foundation in programming concepts, which was necessary for effective problem-solving and 
        decision-making in web development. Core learning also helped me develop a growth mindset, which was essential for 
        success in programming and other areas of life. Taking a break from constant programming practice to focus on personal 
        development was beneficial for my overall well-being and productivity.
