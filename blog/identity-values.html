    <p><b>&bull;An Ethical Decision
    </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In my  life, I was once faced with an ethical decision when I found a wallet lying on the ground in a busy shopping center. 
      The wallet contained a significant amount of cash, as well as credit cards and identification. 
<br>
      However,  I thought about the distress and inconvenience that the rightful owner would experience if they realized their wallet was missing,
      and I knew that I had a responsibility to do the right thing and return it to them.
<br>
     After careful consideration, I decided to try to find the rightful owner of the wallet. 
     I looked through the wallet to see if there were any clues about who it might belong to, and I found a business card for a local company.
     I called the company and explained the situation, and they were able to provide me with the contact information for the wallet's owner. 
     I arranged to meet the owner in a public place and returned the wallet to them, along with all of its contents.
<br>
    The owner was extremely grateful and relieved to have their wallet back, and they offered to reward me for my honesty. 
    However, I declined the reward and explained that I had simply done what I believed was the right thing to do.
<br>
    Reflecting on the decision now, I am confident that it was the right choice. 
    The situation served as a reminder of the importance of doing the right thing, even when it may be difficult or inconvenient.
    It also reinforced my belief in the power of honesty and integrity, and the positive impact that these values can have on the lives of others.
      
    <p><b>&bull;Culture, Values and Identity
    </b>
    </p>
    <p>
       My culture and the people around me have significantly influenced my values and identity,
       shaping my perspective and interactions in daily life. Growing up, I looked up to my parents as role models, 
       adopting many of their beliefs, behaviors, and character traits. As I grew older, I began to develop my own opinions 
       and beliefs based on life experiences, but my parents continued to have a strong impact on my identity formation.
<br>
    I have learned to appreciate and respect diversity, which has helped me build stronger relationships with my friends and husband.
    My husband and I come from different cultural backgrounds, and our values and beliefs sometimes differ. However, our diverse perspectives 
    have enriched our relationship and helped us learn from each other. We have learned to communicate openly and respectfully, listening to 
    each other's perspectives and finding common ground. Our cultural differences have become a source of strength and resilience in our
    relationship, allowing us to navigate challenges and celebrate our unique identities.
    </p>

    <p><b>&bull;My key strengths
    </b>
    </p>
    <p>
    Creativity: the ability to come up with new and original ideas.
    <br>
Communication: the ability to express thoughts and ideas clearly and effectively.
<br>
Adaptability: the ability to adjust to new situations and changes.
<br>
Critical thinking: the ability to analyze information, identify problems, and make sound decisions.
<br>
Problem Solving:my strength in never giving up on tasks,I understand that problem-solving is a process that often requires time, 
effort, and patience. By staying motivated and determined, I am better equipped to tackle complex problems and find creative solutions.
<br>
</p>

<p><b>&bull;My limitations
</b>
</p>

<p>
  Difficulty concentrating: When I am stuck with problem , it has to be difficult to maintain focus.
  </p>

  <p><b>&bull;
   Strategies and Reflections
</b>
</p>
<p>
  One time, I was working on a group project, and there was tension because some team members had different ideas about how to 
  approach the task.I listened carefully to everyone's perspectives to understand their viewpoints.I suggested combining different ideas 
  to find a middle ground that everyone could agree on.I communicated openly about our goals and the importance of working together.
  Listening helped me understand others' concerns, but it didn't completely resolve the tension.
<br>
In future situations, I would focus more on building trust and fostering a collaborative environment from the beginning.
I would encourage team members to share their ideas without fear of judgment and emphasize the value of diversity in perspectives.
