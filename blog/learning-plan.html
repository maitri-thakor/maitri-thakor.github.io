    <h2><u>Bootcamp Learning Plan</u></h2>


    <p><b>1.What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b></p>
    <p>My long-term goal is to have a successful career in the tech industry, using the skills I learn from this 
      course. I want to help make the tech world more diverse and contribute to cool projects. I plan to start with 
      entry-level and mid-level jobs in software development, quality assurance, and data analytics. Ultimately,
       I want to become a data analyst or scientist, helping people make better decisions using data.</p>

    <p><b>2.What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</b></p>
    <p>My biggest strength is my determination—I never give up, and I'm willing to invest time to succeed.
       However, I know I need to manage my time well. I'll work hard and use my time wisely to excel in Bootcamp. 
       As for my limitations, I find it challenging to identify and resolve errors, which can be frustrating. 
       When stuck on one topic, I struggle to focus on the next, leading to time loss in resolving errors.</p>

    <p><b>3.What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</b></p>
    <p>My main non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be staying focused and organized for the nine weeks.
       I've had interruptions during Foundations that sometimes make it hard to concentrate, but I'm hoping Bootcamp 
       will help me get back on track. Working well in groups and speaking in front of others might also be tough for
        me. Even though I like teamwork, I'm worried about slowing down or asking for
         help while working with a team.</p>

    <p><b>4.What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b></p>
    <p>I believe it's important to address weaknesses and work on areas that slow me down. Improving self-awareness 
      is one aspect I'd like to focus on, as it can benefit various areas such as teamwork and being more comfortable 
      asking for help, especially when working in groups. At Dev Academy, I want to work on my communication and
      teamwork. </p>
    
    <p><b>5.What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</b></p>
    <p>I expect the Bootcamp team to be as supportive and kind as the Foundations team. 
      I hope for timely answers, helpful resources, and lots of patience, just like I've experienced so far.</p>

    <p><b>6.What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</b></p>
    <p>My expectations of myself on Bootcamp are to work hard, stay organized, and participate actively. 
      I will manage my time well, stay positive, and ask for help when I need it. I want to learn and improve 
      both technically and personally, and give my best effort every day.</p>

    <br>

    <h2><u>Foundations Learning Plan</u></h2>

      I have to stay updated with emerging trends, tools, and technologies in software development and quality assurance.
      Prepare for job interviews, and leverage my network to explore job opportunities.
       I will gain experience, seek opportunities for career advancement, such as  developer roles, technical leadership positions,Quality assurance.

    <p><b>2.A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</b>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      My strengths:-I am access information and assistance at any time, which can be especially beneficial for self-paced
      learning and troubleshooting during projects. I never give up on tasks are driven by a strong sense of motivation and determination.
<br>
      Limitations:-Web development requires strong problem-solving skills to debug code, troubleshoot issues,
       and implement solutions effectively. As developers I find  challenging to identify and resolve errors, leading to frustration.
       When I am stuck on one topic,i can't focus on next topic.
    </p>

    <p><b>3.What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b>
    </p>
    <p>

    As Developer helps to  setbacks, cope with stress, and maintain a positive outlook in challenging situations.
    Simplifying  with very simple terms and breaking down the big problem into small problems.
      
    </p>

    <p><b>4.A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      <br>&bull;An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other
       learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
       <br>&bull;What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you 
    </b>
    </p>
    <p>I am using time tracking tools to monitor how you allocate your time throughout the day. 
      I am trying to Identify patterns, track progress towards my goals, and make adjustments as 
      needed to optimize my productivity and efficiency.
      Clear and respectful communication is essential for productive collaboration. 
      Actively listen to others, express ideas thoughtfully, and seek clarification when needed.
      <br>
      I tying take breaks as needed. Engage in activities that help me relax and recharge, 
      such as going for a walk or listening to calming music.
      
    </p>

    <p><b>5.A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Break down the problem into smaller steps.
    Take advantage of online resources such as google ,youtube ,tutorial videos, academic websites.
    However,I do contact with Facilitators for resolve the problem.It is easy to understand the problem.
    </p>

    <p><b>6.A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have  positive experiences with facilitation teams that have provided timely answers, great resources, and a lot of patience. 
    </p>

    <p><b>7.Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
      For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I can effectively manage my schedule, prioritize my time, and ensure that  allocate sufficient time for both  professional and personal needs.  

      Utilizing calendar tools or scheduling apps that can help me to visualize my commitments and maintain a balanced and organized schedule.
