    <p><b>1.Were blocked on a simple problem:</b>
    </p> 
    <p>I was working on a coding problem that required me to iterate through an 
    array of numbers and apply a certain rule to each number. The rule was that if a number was divisible by 3, 
    I had to replace it with the string "Fizz". If a number was divisible by 5, I had to replace it with the string 
    "Buzz". If a number was divisible by both 3 and 5, I had to replace it with the string "FizzBuzz".
    </p>

    <p>The problem I was facing was that my code was not working as expected. 
      It was replacing all numbers with "FizzBuzz", even though some numbers were not divisible by 3 or 5.</p>

    <p>To solve this problem, I used a different approach. Instead of using a single function to check for divisibility by
       3, 5, and both 3 and 5, I created a separate function for each condition. This made my code easier to understand and 
       debug.</p>

       <p>I felt a mix of frustration and satisfaction throughout the process. 
        Frustration because I couldn't figure out why my original code wasn't working as expected. 
        Satisfaction because I was able to find a solution by breaking down the problem into smaller parts and using a
         different approach.</p>

         <p>What I learned from this experience is that sometimes, the best way to solve a problem is to break it
           down into smaller, more manageable parts. This allows you to focus on one part of the problem at a time,
            making it easier to identify and fix any issues.</p>

            <p><b>2. Elegantly solved a problem:</b>
            </p>
            <p>The problem was to complete the getAverage function that takes a name parameter and returns the average
               of that student's test scores. The gradebook object was provided, and we could call the average function
                within the getAverage function.</p>
            <p>To solve this problem elegantly, I read the problem statement carefully and made sure I understood what was 
              being asked.I knew that I needed to access the testScores property of the student object in the gradebook object.
               I also knew that I could use the average function to calculate the average of the scores.</p> 

            <p>I used the studentName parameter to access the student object in the gradebook object.
               I then accessed the testScores property of the student object and passed it to the average function.</p>

            <p>I felt confident and focused throughout the process. I knew what I needed to do and how to do it.
               I was able to write the solution quickly and easily for this code.</p>

            <p>This problem was a good reminder that sometimes the most elegant solution is the simplest one.
               By focusing on the problem and breaking it down into smaller parts, I was able to write a solution
                that was concise and easy to understand.</p>

            <p><b>4.Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.
               What might you try differently next time?: </b>
            </p> 

            <p>I notice that when i am Stuck at one problem then it's difficult to work with as per time-box.
              I always tried to find out my problem on google.So I am try to resolve the  code but if it's not working and 
               much time consuming then i am directly ask to facilitator.</p>
